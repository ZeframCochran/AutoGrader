# AutoGrader
## A tool to check student homework for the intro java class
Roadmap:

0. Check for Syntax errors

1. Diff output

2. Unit test student methods

3. Gather student name from top comment

4. Checks variable names for proper capitalization

*From the Instructor:*

1. Your program's output must match the sample output provided
  * I will check this with something similar to diff.
2. Proper logic
  * I'll check this by checking for at least one method (the one described in the problem statement) and unit testing.
2. Proper variable naming
  * I'll make a list of identifiers and check that they are appropriate using regex.
3. Proper indentation

  * I've not come up with a strategy for this yet.

4. Proper use of methods

  * Students must have at least 2 (main and another)

5. Proper use of comments

  * Each method should be preceded by a comment (According to the instructor)

6. Must provide comments at the beginning of your program with the following information

  * Name
  * Date created
  * HW#
  * Program description

7. You are not allowed to change any of the method's headers

  * This is likely to enable automatic grading, but I dont like it, because I did not like some of the method headers provided.

8. Programs written without methods will receive zero points

  * I will check for at least 2 methods (main and another)
