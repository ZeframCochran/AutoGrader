# AutoGrader
## A tool to check student homework for the intro java class
Features:
Diff output
Unit test student methods
Gather student name from top comment
Checks variable names for proper capitalization

## From the Instructor:
1. Your program’s output must match the sample output provided

I will check this with something similar to diff.

2. Proper logic

I'll check this by checking for at least one method (the one described in the problem statement) and unit testing.

3. Proper variable naming

I'll make a list of identifiers and check that they are appropriate using regex.

4. Proper indentation

I've not come up with a strategy for this yet.

5. Proper use of methods

Students must have at least 2 (main and another)

6. Proper use of comments

Each method should be preceded by a comment (According to the instructor)

7. Must provide comments at the beginning of your program with the following information

Name
Date created
 HW#
 Program description

8. You are not allowed to change any of the method’s headers

This is likely to enable automatic grading, but I dont like it, because I did not like some of the method headers provided.

9. Programs written without methods will receive zero points

I will check for at least 2 methods (main and another)
